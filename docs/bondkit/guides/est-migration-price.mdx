## Overview

Migration initializes a Uniswap v4 pool. The contract computes `sqrtPriceX96` from bonding state.

## Practical approach

- Use bonding reads to approximate price near the target:
- `getCurrentBondingCurvePricePerToken()`
- `getBondingProgress()`

## Considerations

- The final split and liquidity amount can affect initial ticks.
- Slippage protections are applied when adding liquidity.
- For ERC20 quote assets, ensure pair and decimals are accounted for when converting to `sqrtPriceX96`.

<Note>
Exact initialization math is handled on-chain. Use reads for UI estimation; treat final on-chain initialization as source of truth.
