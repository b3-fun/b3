## Overview

BondKit supports bonding against ETH or an allowed ERC20 (e.g., B3). Your choice impacts UX, integrations, and liquidity at migration.

## When to use ETH

- Broad accessibility; most users hold ETH on Base
- Simpler UX (no prior approvals)
- Direct ETH liquidity at migration

## When to use an ERC20 (e.g., B3)

- Aligns with an existing token economy
- Can bootstrap deeper token‑token pairs at migration
- Requires approvals before buys/sells

## Operational differences

- 5% fee on buys and sells for both ETH and ERC20
- ERC20 flows require `approve` before curve interactions
- Migration pairs are created against WETH or the chosen ERC20

<Note>
Confirm the allowed‑list for ERC20 quote assets with the team. By default only specific assets may be enabled.
