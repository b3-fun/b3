## Understanding Aggressiveness Impact

The aggressiveness factor determines how much advantage early buyers get. Higher values create steeper price increases that reward early participation.

### Impact at Different Levels

| Range | Early Buyer Advantage | Best For | Price Behavior |
|-------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| **0-20** | 1.5-2x advantage | Fair launches, community tokens | Nearly linear pricing |
| **30-60** | 2-3x advantage | Most projects, balanced approach | Moderate curve |
| **70-100** | 3-6x advantage | Hype launches, reward believers | Steep curve |

<Note>
At maximum aggressiveness (100), early buyers can get **6x more tokens** than late buyers for the same amount of B3!
</Note>

## Decision Framework

### Choose Low (0-30) If:
- **Goal**: Fair distribution for everyone
- **Community**: Values equality over early rewards
- **Timeline**: Want steady, predictable growth
- **Risk**: Prefer minimal price volatility

### Choose Medium (30-70) If:
- **Goal**: Balanced approach with some early incentive
- **Community**: Mix of early supporters and general public
- **Timeline**: Moderate fundraising pace
- **Risk**: Comfortable with some price variance

### Choose High (70-100) If:
- **Goal**: Maximum early adopter rewards
- **Community**: Strong core believers
- **Timeline**: Want fast fundraising
- **Risk**: Comfortable with high price swings

## Real Impact Example

**Project Setup:** 10M B3 target, buying 1M B3 worth

| Aggressiveness | Early Buyer Gets | Late Buyer Gets | Advantage |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 0 | ~100K tokens | ~100K tokens | 1x (no advantage) |
| 50 | ~208K tokens | ~114K tokens | 1.8x advantage |
| 100 | ~306K tokens | ~49K tokens | 6.2x advantage |

## Configuration Example

```typescript
const config = {
  name: "My Token",
  symbol: "MTK", 
  aggressivenessFactor: 75, // High reward for early buyers
  targetAmount: parseEther("100"), // 100 B3 target
  finalTokenSupply: parseEther("1000000"), // 1M tokens
  // ...other params
};
```
