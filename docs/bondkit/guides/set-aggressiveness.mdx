title: "Set aggressivenessFactor"
description: "How to pick aggressivenessFactor (0–100) for your launch."
---

## Guidance

- 0–20: gentle; early and late buyers receive similar amounts per unit
- 30–60: balanced; moderate price rise, typical for general launches
- 70–100: steep; strong early advantage, faster price escalation

## Rule of thumb

- Smaller targets or tight communities: lean higher (50–80)
- Larger targets or broader audiences: lean lower (20–50)

## Example

```ts
const config = {
  aggressivenessFactor: 35,
  // ...other params
};
```

<Note>
`exponent = 1 / (1 + aggressivenessFactor/100)`. Higher aggressiveness increases curve steepness and reduces tokens per unit later in bonding.
