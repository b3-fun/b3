## Product flow at a glance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">
    Deploy a new ERC20 bond token via the factory clone with your parameters:
    name, symbol/logo, total supply, quote asset (ETH or allowed ERC20), target, and `aggressivenessFactor`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bond">
    Trading happens in the bonding phase. Buys/sells accumulate the quote asset (ETH or allowed ERC20 such as B3).
    Pricing progression is defined in‑contract and shaped by `aggressivenessFactor` (0–100).
    Backend services index creation and trades for analytics (e.g., OHLCV).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate">
    Once the target is reached, the creator calls `migrateToDex()`.
    The contract computes `sqrtPriceX96`, initializes a Uniswap v4 pool, renounces ownership,
    and the token transitions to standard ERC20 trading on Uniswap v4.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key actors

- **Creator**: Configures parameters and initiates migration when the target is hit.
- **Traders**: Participate during bonding; later trade on Uniswap v4.
- **Backend**: Indexes events, stores history/metadata, and serves analytics to frontends.

## On‑chain components

- **Factory**: Deploys new bond tokens using minimal‑proxy/clone from the implementation.
- **Bond Token (Implementation)**: ERC20 with bonding‑phase pricing and migration logic.
- **Uniswap v4 Pool**: Initialized during migration; becomes the primary venue for price discovery.

## Off‑chain components

- **Analytics Backend**: Records creations and trades; exposes OHLCV and historical data.

## Parameters that shape behavior

- **Quote asset**: ETH or an allowed ERC20 (currently B3); set at creation.
- **Target**: Quote‑asset threshold enabling `migrateToDex()`.
- **AggressivenessFactor**: 0 (≈linear) to 100 (steep). Higher = faster price escalation during bonding.

<Note>
After migration, ownership is renounced to the zero address. Plan any admin actions for the bonding phase.
