## What is BondKit?

BondKit is a complete token launch platform for creating ERC20 "bond tokens" on Base mainnet. It provides an end‑to‑end solution that handles everything from initial token creation through bonding curve trading and finally migration to Uniswap v4 for full decentralized trading.

### Key Components

    - ERC20 implementation with bonding curve logic
    - Automatic Uniswap v4 pool initialization
    - Gas-optimized minimal proxy pattern
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript SDK">
    **Developer-Friendly Tools**
    - Simple API for all contract interactions
    - Type-safe interfaces with full TypeScript support
    - Built-in transaction management
    - Event subscriptions and monitoring
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Analytics Backend">
    **Real-Time Data Services**

### The Three-Phase Lifecycle

1. **Creation Phase**: Deploy your token with custom parameters
2. **Bonding Phase**: Automated market making via bonding curve
3. **DEX Phase**: Full decentralized trading on Uniswap v4

## Core Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🏭 Factory Pattern Deployment">
    - **Gas-Efficient Clones**: Uses minimal proxy pattern to reduce deployment costs by ~90%
    - **Standardized Implementation**: All tokens share the same battle-tested logic
    - **One-Click Deployment**: Simple function call to create a new token
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="📈 Dynamic Bonding Curve">
    - **Configurable Aggressiveness**: Factor from 0-100 controls price progression
    - **Automatic Price Discovery**: Market-driven pricing during bonding phase
    - **Buy & Sell Support**: Full two-way trading during bonding
    - **5% Trading Fee**: Applied to both buys and sells, distributed to fee recipient
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="🎯 Target-Based Migration">
    - **Customizable Targets**: Set your funding goal in ETH or allowed ERC20
    - **Automatic Threshold Detection**: Contract tracks progress to target
    - **One-Click Migration**: Simple call to `migrateToDex()` when ready
    - **Price Calculation**: `sqrtPriceX96` computed on-chain for fair initial pricing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="🔄 Uniswap v4 Integration">
    - **Automatic Pool Creation**: Pool initialized with bonding curve exit price
    - **Liquidity Provision**: Accumulated funds become initial liquidity
    - **Ownership Renouncement**: Contract becomes fully decentralized post-migration
    - **Seamless Transition**: No manual intervention required
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="📊 Analytics & Monitoring">
    - **Real-Time Indexing**: All transactions recorded and processed
    - **OHLCV Data**: Professional trading charts available via API
    - **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail for every token
    - **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor multiple tokens and positions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
