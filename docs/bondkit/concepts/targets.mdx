description: "Understanding targetAmount, when migration can happen, and what occurs during migration."

## Target amount

- `targetAmount` is the quote‑asset threshold that enables migration.
- Set at creation; denominated in the quote asset (ETH or an allowed ERC20).
- The bonding phase ends once total raised reaches the target (excess contributions are refunded).

## Who can migrate

- Only the token owner/creator (migration admin) can call `migrateToDex()`.

## What happens at migration

- Split of accumulated quote asset:
  - Portion to `feeRecipient`, based on `lpSplitRatioFeeRecipientBps`.
  - Remainder used as liquidity alongside tokens reserved for LP.
- For Uniswap v4 migration, the contract computes `sqrtPriceX96` to initialize the pool.
- Liquidity is added to the v4 pool with appropriate safeguards; LP tokens or positions are handled per v4 semantics, with ownership effectively burned/renounced for decentralization.
- Ownership is renounced immediately to finalize decentralization.

## Post‑migration

- Bonding‑phase trading is disabled.
- Token behaves as a standard ERC20 with DEX‑based price discovery.
