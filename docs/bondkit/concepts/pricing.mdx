## Bonding curve model

Let final token supply be `S_final`, amount of base tokens raised be `R`, and target amount be `R_target`.

- Token supply during bonding: `S = S_final × (R / R_target)^exponent`
- Where `exponent = 1 / (1 + aggressivenessFactor/100)`

Implications:
- **Lower aggressiveness (0–30)**: flatter curve; later buyers receive amounts similar to early buyers.
- **Medium (30–70)**: balanced; price rises at a moderate pace.
- **Higher (70–100)**: steeper; price rises quickly; later buyers receive fewer tokens per unit.

## Practical notes

- The contract caps the curve at `R_target` and refunds excess.
- Sells compute the inverse to return base tokens for a given token reduction, minus fees.
- The contract uses fixed‑point math for stability; edge cases are handled for very small amounts.
