## What You'll Need

- **MetaMask** or any Web3 wallet
- **USDC on Base** network (minimum 1 USDC)
- **Your ad creative** (image URL and landing page)

<Note>
  Don't have USDC on Base? Bridge from Ethereum using [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org)
</Note>

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to [x402 Ad Marketplace](https://explorer.b3.fun/apps/x402-ad-marketplace)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right
3. Choose MetaMask (or your preferred wallet)
4. Approve the connection

<Warning>
  The marketplace only works on **Base network**. You'll be prompted to switch if you're on a different network.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Browse Available Sites

Scroll through the available sites or use the **"Available Sites"** tab. Each site shows:

- Site name and URL
- Monthly visitors
- Traffic by country
- Available ad formats
- Hourly pricing

Click **"View Details"** on any site to see more information.

## Step 3: Choose Your Ad Format

Select one of three ad formats:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Banner (Recommended)">
    **970×250 pixels** - Wide banner format
    
    **Price:** 1 USDC per hour
    
    Best for: Cost-effective campaigns with good visibility
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sidebar">
    **300×600 pixels** - Vertical side placement
    
    **Price:** 2 USDC per hour
    
    Best for: Persistent visibility as users scroll
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Leaderboard">
    **728×90 pixels** - Top banner position
    
    **Price:** 3 USDC per hour
    
    Best for: Maximum visibility and brand awareness
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Select Time & Duration

Use the calendar to pick:

1. **Start date** - When your ad goes live
2. **Start time** - Hour to start (shown in your timezone)
3. **Duration** - How many hours to run (1-168 hours)

The calendar shows:
- ✅ **Green** = Available slots
- 🔴 **Red** = Already booked
- ⚪ **Gray** = Past time

<Info>
  Minimum booking: 1 hour. Maximum: 7 days (168 hours)
</Info>

## Step 5: Upload Your Ad

Provide your ad details:

```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://yourdomain.com/ad-banner.png",  // Required
  "linkUrl": "https://yourdomain.com/landing-page",    // Required
  "altText": "Your tagline or description"             // Optional
}
```

**Image Requirements:**
- Must be HTTPS URL
- Match the slot dimensions exactly
- Supported: PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG
- Max size: 2MB recommended
- Make sure image loads fast

<Warning>
  Test your image URL before submitting! Broken images cannot be refunded.
</Warning>

## Step 6: Review & Confirm

Review your booking:

- **Site:** Where your ad appears
- **Format:** Banner / Sidebar / Leaderboard
- **Duration:** Start and end time
- **Total Cost:** Hours × hourly rate

Example: 3 hours × 1 USDC = **3 USDC total**

Click **"Purchase Ad Slot"** when ready.

## Step 7: Approve Payment

MetaMask will pop up asking you to **sign a message** (NOT a transaction).

This is the x402 gasless payment:
- ✅ No transaction fee
- ✅ No gas cost
- ✅ Just one signature
- ✅ Instant settlement

Click **"Sign"** to complete your purchase.

<Info>
  This is a cryptographic signature for payment authorization - it's NOT a blockchain transaction, so there's no gas fee!
</Info>

## Step 8: Success!

You'll see:

```
🎉 Successfully purchased ad slot! 
Booking ID: abc123xyz
```

Your ad will:
- ✅ Go live at your scheduled start time
- ✅ Run for your selected duration
- ✅ Appear in "My Ads Bookings" tab

## View Your Campaign

Click the **"My Ads Bookings"** tab to see:

- All your active and scheduled ads
- Start and end times
