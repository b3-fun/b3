# Gasless Payments with x402

x402 is the payment protocol that powers the Ad Marketplace. It lets you pay for things in crypto **without gas fees** - just one signature and you're done.

## The Problem with Traditional Crypto Payments

Buying things with crypto is usually painful:

❌ **Step 1:** Approve token spending (costs gas)  
❌ **Step 2:** Wait for confirmation  
❌ **Step 3:** Make payment (costs more gas)  
❌ **Step 4:** Wait again  
❌ **Step 5:** Gas fees that vary wildly  

**Result:** Bad UX, unpredictable costs, multiple steps

## The x402 Way

✅ **One Signature** - Sign once, done  
✅ **Zero Gas Fees** - Pay only the product price  
✅ **Instant** - Settled immediately  
✅ **Simple** - Feels like web2  

**Result:** Amazon-like checkout experience in web3

## How It Works (Simple Version)

Instead of sending a transaction, you **sign a message** authorizing the payment.

1. You click "Buy"
2. MetaMask asks you to **sign** (not send a transaction)
3. Payment is instantly settled on-chain
4. You pay **zero gas**

<Info>
  The signature is a cryptographic authorization that allows the payment to be processed without you paying gas fees.
</Info>

## Real Example: Buying an Ad Slot

### Traditional Way

```
1. Approve USDC spending
   → MetaMask transaction
   → Pay $2-5 in gas
   → Wait 12 seconds
   
2. Make payment
   → Another MetaMask transaction  
   → Pay $3-8 in gas
   → Wait 12 more seconds

Total time: ~30 seconds
Total gas fees: $5-13
Steps: 4 clicks + 2 confirmations
```

### x402 Way

```
1. Sign payment authorization
   → MetaMask signature request
   → Pay $0 in gas
   → Instant

Total time: ~3 seconds
Total gas fees: $0
Steps: 1 click + 1 signature
```

## Why Zero Gas?

You're probably wondering: "How can there be no gas fees?"

Here's the secret:

1. You sign a **permit** message (not a transaction)
2. The x402 **facilitator** submits the transaction for you
3. The facilitator pays the gas
4. You just pay the product price

<Note>
  Think of it like a credit card payment - you don't pay the payment processor's fees, the merchant does. Same concept here.

## What You're Signing

When MetaMask pops up, you'll see something like:

```
Sign message to authorize payment

From: Your address
To: Merchant address
Amount: 9 USDC
Token: USDC on Base
```

This is **NOT a transaction**. It's a cryptographic signature that authorizes the payment.

<Warning>
  Always verify the amount and recipient address before signing!
</Warning>

## Security

x402 is secure because:

- ✅ **You control the signature** - No one can make you sign
- ✅ **Expiration time** - Signatures expire (can't be replayed)
- ✅ **One-time use** - Each signature has a unique nonce
- ✅ **Amount locked** - Can't charge more than you approve
- ✅ **Protected from MEV** - Private relay prevents frontrunning

## Supported Networks

x402 works on:

- ✅ **Base** (what Ad Marketplace uses)
- ✅ Ethereum Mainnet
- ✅ Polygon
- ✅ Arbitrum
- ✅ Optimism

## Supported Tokens

Currently, the Ad Marketplace accepts:

- **USDC on Base** - Primary payment method

<Note>
  More tokens coming soon! The protocol supports any ERC-20 token with permit functionality.
</Note>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is this safe?">
    Yes! You're signing a message, not giving unlimited access to your tokens. Each signature is for a specific amount, to a specific recipient, and expires quickly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who pays the gas if I don't?">
    The x402 facilitator (run by the AnySpend network) pays the gas fees. They make this back through facilitator fees paid by merchants.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get scammed?">
    Not if you verify what you're signing! Always check:
    - Amount matches what you expect
    - Recipient is the correct address
    - You're on the right network (Base)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my signature expires?">
    Signatures expire after a few minutes for security. If yours expires, just sign again - it's instant and free.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need a special wallet?">
    No! x402 works with any Web3 wallet: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Technical Term

The technical term for what you're signing is an **EIP-2612 Permit** or **EIP-3009 Transfer Authorization**.

It's a standard way for tokens to allow approvals via signatures instead of transactions.

## Try It Yourself

The best way to understand x402 is to experience it:

<Card
  title="Buy an Ad Slot"
  icon="rocket"
  href="https://explorer.b3.fun/apps/x402-ad-marketplace"
>
  Experience zero-gas payments firsthand
</Card>

You'll immediately see the difference - no gas fees, instant confirmation, seamless UX.

## Why This Matters

x402 makes crypto payments feel like **normal internet payments**.

- No waiting for confirmations
- No worrying about gas prices
- No multi-step approval flows
- Just click, sign, done

This is how crypto payments **should** work.
