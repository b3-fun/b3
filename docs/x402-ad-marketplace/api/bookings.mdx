## Tips for Managing Campaigns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track Your Bookings">
    Save your booking IDs and transaction hashes for your records.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Plan Ahead">
    Check availability before your preferred times get booked by others.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Performance">
    Use UTM parameters in your link URL to track clicks:

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Calculate Your ROI

Track these metrics to measure success:

1. **Total Spend** - Sum of all booking costs
2. **Clicks** - Use UTM tracking in your URLs
3. **Conversions** - Sign-ups, purchases, etc.
4. **Cost Per Click** - Total spend ÷ clicks
5. **Cost Per Acquisition** - Total spend ÷ conversions

### Example

```
Campaign: DeFi protocol banner ad
Duration: 12 hours
Cost: 12 USDC (12 × 1 USDC)
Clicks: 450
Signups: 45

Cost per click: 12 ÷ 450 = $0.027
Cost per signup: 12 ÷ 45 = $0.27
```

## Common Questions

    Contact support if issues persist.
