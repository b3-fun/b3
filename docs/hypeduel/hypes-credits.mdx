description: "Platform-native gaming currency that enables instant betting without blockchain friction"

**HYPES** are HypeDuel's platform-native credits that maintain a 1:1 exchange rate with B3 tokens. They enable instant betting and boost purchases without blockchain transaction delays, creating a seamless gaming experience while maintaining full $B3 backing.

## Core Concept

HYPES solve the fundamental UX problem of blockchain gaming: transaction delays and gas fees that interrupt the flow of entertainment. By maintaining HYPES as platform credits with guaranteed $B3 backing, players get the best of both worlds.
