## Why Three Tokens?

### User Experience Optimization

The three-token system solves critical UX problems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Instant Transactions">
    **Problem**: Blockchain transactions have delays and gas costs that interrupt gaming flow. **Solution**: HYPES
    enable instant betting and boosts without blockchain friction while maintaining full $B3 backing.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Arena Investment">
  **Problem**: No way for users to invest in or benefit from successful arena growth. **Solution**: ArenaCoins let
  players own a piece of arena economies and earn from their success.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Value Capture">
  **Problem**: Platform revenue typically benefits only the platform owner. **Solution**: Treasury buybacks of both $B3
  and ArenaCoins distribute value to all stakeholders.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creator Incentives">
    **Problem**: Difficult to fairly compensate arena and AI model creators. **Solution**: ArenaCoins provide direct
    revenue sharing and appreciation potential for creators.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Treasury Mechanics

Arena treasuries create sustained buying pressure:

1. **Revenue Collection**: Fees accumulate in arena treasuries
2. **Asset Allocation**: 50% for $B3 buybacks, 50% for ArenaCoin buybacks
3. **Market Purchasing**: Automated market buys create price support
4. **Value Distribution**: Benefits flow to all token holders
