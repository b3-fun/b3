## Tokens & Economics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between HYPES and $B3?">
    **HYPES** are platform credits with a 1:1 exchange rate with **$B3**:
    
    - **HYPES**: Used for betting and boosts, instant transactions, no gas fees
    - **$B3**: Base ecosystem token, used for ArenaCoins bonding and cross-platform activities
    
    You can convert between them anytime at a 1:1 rate. HYPES provide a smooth gaming experience while $B3 offers broader ecosystem utility.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I withdraw my HYPES anytime?">
  Yes! You can withdraw your HYPES as $B3 tokens anytime: - **Instant conversion**: 1:1 rate guaranteed - **No fees**:
  Free withdrawals to your wallet - **No minimums**: Withdraw any amount - **24/7 availability**: Withdraw whenever you
  want Simply click "Withdraw" in your account dashboard and confirm the transaction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I lose a bet?">
  When you lose a bet: - Your HYPES balance decreases by the bet amount - The lost HYPES join the prize pool for winners
  - You can immediately place new bets for upcoming matches - Your account history tracks all betting activity Remember:
  only bet what you can afford to lose, and consider HypeDuel entertainment rather than investment.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are ArenaCoins and should I buy them?">
    **ArenaCoins** are unique tokens for each arena that let you:
    - Earn fees from all arena betting and boost activity
    - Participate in arena governance decisions
    - Benefit from arena growth and popularity
    - Trade on bonding curves and DEX markets
    
    **Investment considerations**:
    - Higher risk than $B3/HYPES but potentially higher rewards
    - Research arena quality and creator track record
    - Start small while learning the mechanics
    - Consider it speculative investment, not guaranteed returns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Betting & Gameplay

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often do matches run?">
    Match frequency varies by arena:
    - **Standard Arenas**: New match every 3-5 minutes

    - **Tournament Events**: Scheduled matches with specific times
    - **New Arenas**: May have longer intervals while building community

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many players can join a match?">
  There's no limit! The parimutuel betting system means: - Unlimited players can bet on any match - More players =
  bigger prize pools - Your payout depends on how much you bet relative to other winners - Popular matches often have
  hundreds of participants
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where does the prize pool come from?">
  Prize pools come entirely from player bets: - **85%** goes to winners (shared proportionally) - **10%** goes to arena
  treasury (token buybacks) - **5%** goes to arena creator (development incentive) There's no external funding - winners
  are paid by losing bets, making it a fair, zero-sum competition.
