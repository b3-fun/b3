## ArenaCoin Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Arena Creation & Bonding

When a new arena launches, it enters the **bonding phase**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Arena Launch">Creator deploys new battle environment with unique gameplay</Step>
  <Step title="Bonding Opens">Players can bond $B3 to receive ArenaCoins at curve prices</Step>
  <Step title="Community Building">Early supporters accumulate tokens and build initial community</Step>
  <Step title="Graduation Criteria">Arena reaches bonding targets (liquidity + community size)</Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 2: DEX Trading

After successful bonding, ArenaCoins graduate to full market trading:

- **Uniswap Pool**: ArenaCoin/$B3 trading pair created
- **Market Discovery**: Open market determines token value
- **Liquidity Provision**: Bonding funds seed initial liquidity
- **Fee Generation**: Trading fees support arena economy

## Bonding Curve Mechanics

### Mathematical Foundation

ArenaCoins use a **quadratic bonding curve** for fair price discovery:

```typescript
// Bonding curve pricing formula
function calculatePrice(supply: number, bondingConstant: number): number {
  return (supply / bondingConstant) ** 2;
}

// Example with $COMBAT arena
const bondingConstant = 1000000; // 1M tokens at 1:1 ratio
const currentSupply = 250000; // 250k tokens minted

const pricePerToken = (250000 / 1000000) ** 2;
// = 0.25^2 = 0.0625 $B3 per ArenaCoin
```

### Bonding Example

Let's trace an early investor's journey:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Day 1: Arena Launch">
    - **Arena**: Combat Simulator launches - **Supply**: 0 $COMBAT tokens exist - **Price**: Starting price ≈ 0.001 $B3
    - **Investment**: Alice bonds 100 $B3 - **Received**: ~316 $COMBAT tokens
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Week 2: Growing Interest">
  - **Supply**: 50,000 $COMBAT tokens minted - **Price**: ~0.0025 $B3 per token - **Alice's Holdings**: 316 tokens worth
  ~79 $B3 - **Investment**: Bob bonds 500 $B3 - **Received**: ~200 $COMBAT tokens
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Month 1: Arena Success">
    - **Supply**: 200,000 $COMBAT tokens minted - **Price**: ~0.04 $B3 per token - **Alice's Holdings**: 316 tokens
    worth ~126 $B3 - **Community**: Active battles and growing user base - **Graduation**: Arena approaches DEX listing

## Revenue Sharing Model

ArenaCoins generate value through multiple revenue streams:

### Primary Revenue Sources

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/arenacoin-revenue-dark.png" alt="ArenaCoin Revenue Streams" />

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Betting Fees">
    **10% of all betting pools** - Collected from every battle - Proportional to betting volume - Accumulates in arena
    treasury - Used for token buybacks *Example: 10,000 HYPES betting pool = 1,000 HYPES to treasury*
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Boost Revenue">
  **50% of boost purchases** - Real-time revenue from interactive features - Higher engagement = more revenue - Scales
  with arena popularity - Immediate treasury impact *Example: 500 HYPES in boosts = 250 HYPES to treasury*
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Trading Fees">
    **66% of DEX trading fees** (post-graduation) - Continuous revenue from token trading - Grows with token adoption -
    Market-driven revenue scaling - Long-term sustainability *Example: 1% trading fee, 66% to treasury*
