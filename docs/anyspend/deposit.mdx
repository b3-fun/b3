## What It Does

The AnySpend Deposit page provides a streamlined interface for users to deposit tokens to a specific recipient wallet address. It supports cross-chain deposits, allowing users to pay with tokens from any supported chain while the recipient receives funds on their desired destination chain and token.

This feature is designed for integration with dApps, bots, and services that need to receive token deposits from users.

## How It Works

1. **Deep Link Generation**\
   Your application generates a deposit URL with the recipient address, destination chain, and token.
2. **User Connects Wallet**\
   The user connects their wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase, Rainbow, Rabby, Trust Wallet, etc.).
3. **Token Selection**\
   The user selects which token they want to pay with from their available balances.
4. **Cross-Chain Execution**\
   AnySpend handles the cross-chain routing and conversion to deliver the specified token to the recipient.
5. **Confirmation & Redirect**\
   After completion, users can be redirected back to your application.

## URL Parameters

The deposit page accepts the following URL parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `recipientAddress` | Yes | The wallet address to receive the deposit (valid EVM address) |
| `toChainId` | Yes* | The destination chain ID (e.g., 8453 for Base) |
| `toCurrency` | Yes* | The token contract address on the destination chain |
| `amount` | No | Fixed amount in wei/smallest unit. When provided, user cannot change the amount |
| `redirect_url` | No | HTTPS URL to redirect after completion |
| `redirect_label` | No | Custom label for the redirect button |
| `partner` | No | Partner ID for custom configuration |

\* Not required for Hyperliquid chain where USDC is the default token.

## Example URLs

**Basic deposit to Base USDC:**
```
/deposit?recipientAddress=0x1234...&toChainId=8453&toCurrency=0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
```

**Fixed amount deposit:**
```
/deposit?recipientAddress=0x1234...&toChainId=8453&toCurrency=0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913&amount=1000000
```

**With redirect:**
```
/deposit?recipientAddress=0x1234...&toChainId=8453&toCurrency=0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913&redirect_url=https://yourapp.com/success&redirect_label=Return to App
```

## Supported Wallets

The deposit page supports the following wallets out of the box:

- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Rainbow
- Rabby
- Trust Wallet

Auto-connect is enabled for returning users who have previously connected their wallet.

## Special Chain Support

### Hyperliquid

The deposit page includes special support for Hyperliquid chain:

- USDC uses a special 34-character address format (`0x00000000000000000000000000000000`)
- When `toChainId` is set to Hyperliquid, `toCurrency` defaults to USDC if not specified
- Zero addresses are automatically corrected to the Hyperliquid USDC format

## Partner Integration

Partners can be configured with custom settings:

```typescript
interface PartnerConfig {
  returnToHomeUrl?: string;      // Default redirect URL
  customRecipientLabel?: string; // Custom label for the recipient
  returnHomeLabel?: string;      // Custom label for return button
}
```

To register as a partner, contact the AnySpend team to add your configuration.

## Security

The deposit page includes built-in security measures:

- **Redirect URL Validation**: Only HTTPS URLs are allowed for redirects to prevent open redirect attacks
- **Amount Validation**: Amounts must be valid positive integers (wei values)
- **Address Validation**: Recipient and token addresses are validated before processing

## Common Use Cases

- **Telegram Bots**: Let users fund their bot wallets through a simple link
- **Gaming**: Enable players to deposit tokens to game accounts
- **Marketplaces**: Allow buyers to fund escrow addresses
- **Subscription Services**: Collect recurring payments to a service wallet
- **Tipping**: Enable tipping creators with a shareable deposit link

## Integration Example

Here's how to generate a deposit link in your application:

```typescript
function generateDepositLink({
  recipientAddress,
  chainId,
  tokenAddress,
  amount,
  redirectUrl,
}: {
  recipientAddress: string;
  chainId: number;
  tokenAddress: string;
  amount?: string;
  redirectUrl?: string;
}) {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    recipientAddress,
    toChainId: chainId.toString(),
    toCurrency: tokenAddress,
  });

  if (amount) params.set("amount", amount);
  if (redirectUrl) params.set("redirect_url", redirectUrl);

  return `https://anyspend.b3.fun/deposit?${params.toString()}`;
}
```
