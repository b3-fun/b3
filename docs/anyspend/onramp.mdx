## What it does

Users pay with a card or bank transfer. AnySpend converts the fiat to crypto and executes the onchain transaction in a single flow. The user never has to buy crypto separately.

## How it works

1. **User starts an action** -- minting, staking, a contract call, whatever.
2. **Fiat payment** -- they pay with Stripe or Coinbase Pay.
3. **Conversion + execution** -- AnySpend converts fiat to the right token and executes the transaction.
4. **Delivery** -- tokens land in the user's wallet. Done.

## Payment providers

**Stripe**

- Credit/debit cards worldwide
- 3D Secure authentication
- Automatic currency conversion for non-USD
- Localized payment methods by region

**Coinbase Pay**

- Pay from Coinbase account balance or debit card
- Familiar UX for Coinbase users
- No additional AnySpend fees

New providers can be added through a modular architecture. Routing between providers is automatic based on the user's region.

## Fraud prevention

Each transaction goes through a real-time risk engine:

- **Allow** -- transaction proceeds
- **Verify** -- additional user verification required
- **Block** -- suspicious activity stopped

The engine checks behavioral signals, device fingerprints, and network intelligence.

## Regional support

- Automatic location detection
- Local payment methods and currencies
- Provider selection based on geography
- Regional compliance handled for you

## Fees

| Provider | Fee |
|----------|-----|
| Stripe | 5.4% + $0.30 per transaction |
| Coinbase Pay | No AnySpend fee |

Users see a fee breakdown during checkout before they pay.

## Common use cases

- Mint NFTs with a credit card
