## What It Does

The AnySpend onramp allows users to pay with traditional fiat methods (e.g., credit card, bank transfer) and automatically execute any onchain transaction. This seamless flow eliminates the need for users to manually acquire cryptocurrency or manage wallet funding.

It’s designed to reduce friction for non-crypto-native users, making blockchain-powered products accessible to a broader audience.

## How It Works

1. **User Initiates Action**\
   A user begins an onchain action (e.g., minting, staking, or contract interaction).
2. **Fiat Payment**\
   They pay with a card or bank transfer via Stripe or Coinbase Pay.
3. **Conversion \+ Execution**\
   AnySpend converts fiat to the desired cryptocurrency and executes the transaction.
4. **Wallet Delivery**\
   The result is sent to the user's connected wallet or global wallet. No crypto acquisition required.
