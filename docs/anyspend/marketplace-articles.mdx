## AI Validation Rules

The AI validation endpoint scores your article idea and either approves it as-is, suggests improvements, or rejects it.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="✅ Score ≥80">
    **Perfect!** Your input is approved as-is.
    
    Your provided title or topic is excellent and fits the site's focus. No changes needed - we'll submit it exactly as you wrote it.
    
    **Example:** "How to Use Base Pay for Creators in Your DApp"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="⚠️ Score 70-79">
    **Good with Suggestions!** AI provides an improved version.
    
    Your content is relevant but could be optimized. AI generates a better title and description while keeping your core idea.
    
    **Example Input:** "base pay for creators"
    
    **AI Output:** "Integrating Base Pay: A Complete Guide for Content Creators"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="❌ Score <70">
    **Rejected.** Content doesn't fit the site's focus.
    
    Your topic is off-topic for this site. Try a different topic or choose a different site that better matches your content.
    
    **Example:** Submitting a cooking recipe to a crypto news site
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pricing

Article submission prices vary by site based on their traffic and authority.

**Typical Ranges:**
- Small/emerging sites: $3-50 USDC per submission
- Mid-tier sites: $50-200 USDC per submission
- Premium sites: $200-500 USDC per submission

<Note>
  Prices are set by individual publishers. Check the site details before submitting.

## AI Validation Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write Clear, Specific Titles">
    **Good:** "How to Build a DEX on Base with Uniswap V3"
    
    **Bad:** "DeFi stuff"
    
    Specific titles score higher and are more likely to be approved.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Match Site Focus">
    Check site keywords and description before submitting. A Base-focused article won't score well on a Solana-only site.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Complete Sentences for Titles">
    **Good:** "How to Use Base Pay for Creators in Your DApp"
    
    **Bad:** "base pay creators"
    
    Complete titles (10-200 chars) get higher scores.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Leverage Tweet URLs">
    If you have a viral tweet about your topic, use the URL! AI extracts context and generates a relevant title.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Content rejected' with low score">
    Your topic doesn't fit the site's focus. Options:
    - Choose a different site that matches your topic better
    - Adjust your topic to align with the site's keywords
    - Provide a more specific, detailed title
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Content validation required' error">
    You must call `/articles/validate` first and get approval before calling `/articles/buy`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Insufficient balance' error">
    You need USDC on Base network. Check that:
    - You're connected to Base (Chain ID: 8453)
    - You have enough USDC for the article price
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens after I submit?">
    1. Your request goes to the publisher for review
    2. Publisher evaluates your pitch (typically 1-7 days)
    3. If accepted, they'll write/publish the article
    4. You'll receive the published URL once live
    
    Track status via `/articles/requests/buyer/:address`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I edit my submission after paying?">
    No, submissions are locked after payment. Make sure your content is correct before submitting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if the publisher rejects my article?">
    Publishers rarely reject pre-validated content, but if they do, the status will show "rejected". Refunds are handled case-by-case - contact the publisher directly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Zero Gas with x402

x402 is the payment protocol that makes crypto payments feel like web2.

**Traditional crypto payments:**
- ❌ Multiple transactions (approve + transfer)
- ❌ $5-15 in gas fees
- ❌ 30-60 second wait times
- ❌ Complex multi-step flows

**With x402:**
- ✅ One signature - no transactions
- ✅ Zero gas fees
- ✅ Instant settlement
- ✅ Simple one-click submission

### How It Works

1. You sign a payment authorization message (not a transaction)
2. x402 facilitator submits the transaction for you
3. Facilitator pays the gas
4. You pay only the article price

<Warning>
  Always verify the amount and recipient before signing!
</Warning>

### Security

- ✅ You control the signature
- ✅ Signatures expire (can't be replayed)
- ✅ One-time use with unique nonce
- ✅ Amount is locked (can't charge more)
