## Zero Gas with x402

x402 is the payment protocol that makes crypto payments feel like web2.

**Traditional crypto payments:**
- ❌ Multiple transactions (approve + transfer)
- ❌ $5-15 in gas fees
- ❌ 30-60 second wait times
- ❌ Complex multi-step flows

**With x402:**
- ✅ One signature - no transactions
- ✅ Zero gas fees
- ✅ Instant settlement
- ✅ Simple one-click purchase

### How It Works

1. You sign a payment authorization message (not a transaction)
2. x402 facilitator submits the transaction for you
3. Facilitator pays the gas
4. You pay only the ad price

<Warning>
  Always verify the amount and recipient before signing!
</Warning>

### Security

- ✅ You control the signature
- ✅ Signatures expire (can't be replayed)
- ✅ One-time use with unique nonce
- ✅ Amount is locked (can't charge more)
