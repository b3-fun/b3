# Platform API

The AnySpend Platform API gives you full programmatic control over your payment infrastructure. Build integrations, automate workflows, and let AI agents manage your commerce stack -- all through a clean, Stripe-style REST API.

## Who is this for?

- **Developers** building custom integrations with AnySpend
- **AI agents** that create payment links, manage products, or pull analytics
- **Automation platforms** orchestrating commerce workflows (Zapier, n8n, custom scripts)
- **Backend services** that need to programmatically create checkout sessions or track transactions

## Quick start

Create a payment link in 3 lines:

```bash
curl -X POST https://platform-api.anyspend.com/api/v1/payment-links \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer asp_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Membership",
    "amount": "10000000",
    "token_address": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    "chain_id": 8453,
    "recipient_address": "0xYourAddress..."
  }'
```

The API returns a Stripe-style response with the created resource:

```json
{
  "object": "payment_link",
  "id": "pl_abc123def456",
  "name": "Premium Membership",
  "short_code": "xK9mQ2",
  "amount": "10000000",
  "token_address": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
  "chain_id": 8453,
  "recipient_address": "0xYourAddress...",
  "url": "https://platform-api.anyspend.com/pay/xK9mQ2",
  "is_active": true,
  "items": [],
  "created_at": 1709078400000,
  "updated_at": 1709078400000
}
```

## Associating payments with customers

There are two patterns for linking AnySpend payments back to your users:

### Pattern 1: URL parameters (simple)

Append `client_reference_id` and `metadata` to your payment link URL:

```
https://anyspend.com/pay/xK9mQ2?client_reference_id=order_123&metadata[user_id]=clerk_abc
```

These values flow through to your `payment.completed` webhook automatically.

### Pattern 2: Server-side sessions (enterprise)

Create a checkout session on your backend with full customer context:

```bash
curl -X POST https://platform-api.anyspend.com/api/v1/checkout-sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer asp_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payment_link_id": "pl_abc123def456",
    "client_reference_id": "order_456",
    "customer_email": "alice@example.com",
    "customer_name": "Alice Smith",
    "metadata": { "user_id": "clerk_abc", "plan": "pro" },
    "success_url": "https://example.com/success?session_id={SESSION_ID}"
  }'
```

The response includes a `url` field -- redirect your customer there to pay. All data is included in the webhook when the payment completes.

<Tip>
  See the [Webhooks Guide](/anyspend/api/webhooks-guide#reconciling-payments-with-your-system) for complete examples of reconciling payments in your webhook handler.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://platform-api.anyspend.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication tiers

The API uses three authentication tiers depending on the endpoint:

| Tier | Auth required | Rate limit | Use case |
|------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Open** | None (IP-based rate limiting) | 5 requests/min per IP | Quick Pay -- one-shot payments with no account needed |
| **API Key** | `asp_xxx` key via header | 120 requests/min per key | All standard API operations -- CRUD on payment links, products, transactions, etc. |
| **JWT** | Dashboard session token | Standard session limits | Dashboard-only routes (managed automatically by the web app) |

Most developers will use API Key authentication. See the [Authentication](/anyspend/api/authentication) page for details on creating and managing keys.

## Response format

Every API response follows a consistent Stripe-style format.

### Single resource

```json
{
  "object": "payment_link",
  "id": "pl_abc123def456",
  "name": "Premium Membership",
  "amount": "10000000",
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": 1709078400000
}
```

The `object` field tells you the resource type. The `id` field is a unique identifier.

### List of resources

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    { "object": "payment_link", "id": "pl_abc123...", "name": "Premium" },
    { "object": "payment_link", "id": "pl_def456...", "name": "Basic" }
  ],
  "has_more": true,
  "total_count": 142,
  "url": "/api/v1/payment-links"
}
```

See the [Pagination & Filtering](/anyspend/api/pagination) page for details on navigating list responses.

### Error response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "missing_required_field",
    "message": "The 'name' field is required.",
    "param": "name"
  }
}
```

See the [Errors](/anyspend/api/errors) page for the full error taxonomy.

### Deleted resource

```json
{
  "object": "payment_link",
  "id": "pl_abc123def456",
  "deleted": true
}
```

## Rate limits

Rate limits vary by authentication tier. When you exceed the limit, the API returns a `429` status with a `rate_limit_error`:

| Tier | Limit | Window |
|------|-------|--------|
| Open (Quick Pay) | 5 requests | 1 minute |
| API Key | 120 requests | 1 minute |

The response headers include rate limit information:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 120
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 117
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1709078460
```

## Idempotency

For safe retries on `POST` and `PATCH` requests, include an `Idempotency-Key` header. Duplicate requests with the same key and body return the cached response. See the [Idempotency](/anyspend/api/idempotency) page for details.
