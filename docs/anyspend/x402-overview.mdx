## What is AnySpend X402?

AnySpend X402 is B3's implementation of the **X402 payment protocol** that enables instant, automatic cryptocurrency payments directly over HTTP. Unlike traditional X402 facilitators that only support USDC, **AnySpend allows you to pay with any token** while resource servers receive any token they prefer.

The X402 protocol modernizes the HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code, turning it into a practical solution for machine-to-machine micropayments, paywalled APIs, and autonomous agent interactions.

## For Buyers (Payers)

Pay for paywalled resources using any cryptocurrency you hold:

- **Pay with any token**: Use ETH, DAI, or any ERC-20 token - not just USDC
- **Standard protocol**: Works with any X402-enabled service using standard HTTP
- **No manual swaps**: AnySpend automatically converts your token to what the seller needs
- **Simple integration**: One SDK works across all X402 services

**Use Cases:**
- Access premium APIs and AI agent services
- Pay for computational resources and data feeds
- Enable autonomous agent-to-agent payments
- Consume paywalled content programmatically

## For Sellers (Resource Servers)

Accept payments in USDC while your customers pay with their preferred token:

- **Receive USDC**: Get paid in USDC regardless of what token the customer uses
- **Express middleware**: Add payments to your API with just a few lines of code
- **No blockchain infrastructure**: AnySpend handles all on-chain complexity
- **Instant settlement**: Payments are verified and settled automatically

**Use Cases:**
- Monetize premium APIs and data services
- Build paid AI agent workflows
- Create paywalled content and tools
- Accept crypto payments without crypto expertise

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Client Requests Resource">
User's application makes a standard HTTP request to your API
</Step>

<Step title="Payment Required">
Your API returns `402 Payment Required` with payment details
</Step>

<Step title="Token Preference">
Client specifies their preferred payment token (ETH, DAI, etc.)
</Step>

<Step title="AnySpend Quotes">
AnySpend calculates the equivalent amount in the client's chosen token
</Step>

<Step title="Client Signs Payment">
User signs a cryptographic authorization for their token
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Settlement">
AnySpend swaps the token to USDC and settles to your wallet
</Step>

<Step title="Resource Delivered">
Your API receives payment confirmation and returns the requested resource
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Differentiators

### Multi-Token Support

**Standard X402**: Resource servers and clients must both use USDC

**AnySpend X402**: Clients pay with **any token** they hold. AnySpend handles the conversion.

```
Client pays 0.0003 ETH → AnySpend swaps to 1 USDC → Seller receives 1 USDC
```

### No Infrastructure Required

Resource servers don't need to:
- Run blockchain nodes
- Manage wallets or private keys
- Handle token swaps or bridging
- Monitor transaction status

AnySpend's facilitator handles all blockchain operations and provides simple HTTP endpoints for verification and settlement.

### Standard Protocol Compliance

Clients using AnySpend have **zero awareness** they're using a special facilitator. The entire flow uses standard X402 protocol messages - the multi-token magic happens transparently on the resource server side through middleware.
