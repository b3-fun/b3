## What is AnySpend x402?

AnySpend x402 is B3's implementation of the **x402 payment protocol** that enables instant, automatic cryptocurrency payments directly over HTTP. Unlike traditional x402 facilitators that only support USDC, **AnySpend allows you to pay with any compatible token** (EIP-2612 or EIP-3009) while resource servers receive any token they prefer.

The x402 protocol modernizes the HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code, turning it into a practical solution for machine-to-machine micropayments, paywalled APIs, and autonomous agent interactions.

## For Buyers (Payers)

Pay for paywalled resources using any compatible token you hold:

- **Pay with compatible tokens**: Use any token with EIP-2612 or EIP-3009 support for gasless payments
- **Standard protocol**: Works with any x402-enabled service using standard HTTP
- **No manual swaps**: AnySpend automatically converts your token to what the seller needs
- **Simple integration**: One SDK works across all x402 services

<Card title="Token Compatibility Checker" icon="check-circle" href="https://anyspend.com/x402-tokens">
  Browse compatible tokens with EIP-2612 or EIP-3009 support across 19+ networks
</Card>

**Use Cases:**
- Access premium APIs and AI agent services
- Pay for computational resources and data feeds
- Enable autonomous agent-to-agent payments
- Consume paywalled content programmatically

## For Sellers (Resource Servers)

Accept payments in USDC while your customers pay with their preferred token:

- **Receive USDC**: Get paid in USDC regardless of what token the customer uses
- **Express middleware**: Add payments to your API with just a few lines of code
- **No blockchain infrastructure**: AnySpend handles all on-chain complexity
- **Instant settlement**: Payments are verified and settled automatically

**Use Cases:**
- Monetize premium APIs and data services
- Build paid AI agent workflows
- Create paywalled content and tools
- Accept crypto payments without crypto expertise

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Client Requests Resource">
User's application makes a standard HTTP request to your API
</Step>

<Step title="Payment Required">
Your API returns `402 Payment Required` with payment details
</Step>

<Step title="Token Preference">
Client specifies their preferred payment token (ETH, DAI, etc.)
</Step>

<Step title="AnySpend Quotes">
AnySpend calculates the equivalent amount in the client's chosen token
</Step>

<Step title="Client Signs Payment">
User signs a cryptographic authorization for their token
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Settlement">
AnySpend swaps the token to USDC and settles to your wallet
</Step>

<Step title="Resource Delivered">
Your API receives payment confirmation and returns the requested resource
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Differentiators

### Multi-Token Support

**Standard x402**: Resource servers and clients must both use USDC

**AnySpend x402**: Clients pay with **any compatible token** (EIP-2612 or EIP-3009 support required) they hold. AnySpend handles the conversion.

```
Client pays with DAI (EIP-2612) → AnySpend swaps to 1 USDC → Seller receives 1 USDC
```

### No Infrastructure Required

Resource servers don't need to:
- Run blockchain nodes
- Manage wallets or private keys
- Handle token swaps or bridging
- Monitor transaction status

AnySpend's facilitator handles all blockchain operations and provides simple HTTP endpoints for verification and settlement.

### Standard Protocol Compliance

Clients using AnySpend have **zero awareness** they're using a special facilitator. The entire flow uses standard x402 protocol messages - the multi-token magic happens transparently on the resource server side through middleware.
