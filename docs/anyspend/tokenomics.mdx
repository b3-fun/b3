### What is the $ANY token?

$ANY is the native token of AnySpend and represents alignment between users, partners, and the protocol. Its design follows two guiding principles:

**Community First**: 90% of supply goes to the community (airdrops, rewards, integrations). The AnySpend Foundation receives 10% for transparent operational needs. There are no allocations for "team" or "investors."

**Revenue Aligned**: 95% of protocol revenue â€” from swaps, onramps, trades flows into $ANY buybacks and burns. Holders capture nearly all value generated by the network.

### What is the total supply and contract address of $ANY?

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000

**Contract address**: tktktktktk

## Token Distribution

### How much of $ANY is allocated to investors, team, foundation, users?

$ANY is community driven. No allocation has been given to the team or investors.

90% is reserved to be put into the hands of the community and users. The foundation gets the remaining 10% which is used toward liquidity support, security & audits, ecosystem grants and buybacks.

## Token Utility

### What benefits/utility does the $ANY token have?

- **Discount on Anyspend fees** for $ANY holders
- **Stake $ANY** to earn rebates from platform revenue
- **Governance** over listings, fee schedules, and integrations

### What are the Anyspend fee discounts for holders of $ANY?

## Future Development

### What's AnySpend V2?

AnySpend is evolving into something much larger: a DeFi automation engine. The future of finance is not just buying and swapping tokens, it's programmable money flows, automated strategies, and community-owned infrastructure. V2 of AnySpend will bring this vision to life.
