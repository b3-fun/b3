### What is the $ANY token?

**$ANY** is the native token of AnySpend and represents alignment between users, partners, and the protocol. Its design follows two guiding principles:

**Community First**: 90% of supply goes to the community (airdrops, rewards, integrations). The AnySpend Foundation receives 10% for transparent operational needs. There are no allocations for "team" or "investors."

**Revenue Aligned**: 95% of protocol revenue â€” from swaps, onramps, trades flows into $ANY buybacks and burns. Holders capture nearly all value generated by the network.
