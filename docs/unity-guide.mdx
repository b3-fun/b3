## Code Examples

### Trigger Rules Engine

Here's an example of how to trigger the rules engine from within your Unity game:

```csharp Unity C# Example
B3LauncherClient.TriggerRulesEngine(new B3LauncherClient.TriggerRulesEngineBody
{
    launcherJwt = B3Instance.Instance.SessionJWT ?? jwtInput.text,
    trigger = "open-tip-modal",
    otherWallet = otherWalletInput.text,
}, null);
```

### Session Management

The SDK automatically handles user sessions:

```csharp Session Example
// Access the current session JWT
string sessionToken = B3Instance.Instance.SessionJWT;

// Check if user is authenticated
if (B3Instance.Instance.IsAuthenticated)
{
    // User is logged in and ready to interact with B3 services
    Debug.Log("User authenticated successfully");
}
```

## API Integration

The Unity SDK provides seamless access to all B3 launcher APIs:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Callback-based Calls">
  Traditional callback pattern for handling API responses:
  
  ```csharp
  B3LauncherClient.SomeAPICall(requestData, (response) => {
      // Handle response
      Debug.Log("API call completed");
  });
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Async/Await Calls">
  Modern async/await pattern for cleaner code:
  
  ```csharp
  public async void CallAPI()
  {
      var response = await B3LauncherClient.SomeAPICallAsync(requestData);
      // Handle response
      Debug.Log("API call completed");
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WebGL Webhooks">
  Handle launcher events in WebGL builds:
  
  ```csharp
  // Register webhook handlers
  B3Instance.Instance.OnWebhookReceived += HandleWebhook;
  
  private void HandleWebhook(WebhookData data)
  {
      // Process incoming webhook data
      Debug.Log($"Received webhook: {data.type}");
  }
  ```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
