## Why Use Testnets?

Testnets provide a safe, controlled, and efficient environment for testing and experimentation. Test networks, or testnets, serve as essential tools for you to test your smart contracts before deploying them to the mainnet, minimizing the risk of failures or vulnerabilities in live applications.

### Key Benefits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Risk-Free Testing" icon="shield-check">
    Test your smart contracts and applications without risking real funds or affecting live users.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Realistic Environment" icon="globe">
    Simulate mainnet conditions including network latency, gas fees, and transaction throughput.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cost-Effective Development" icon="dollar-sign">
    Use free testnet tokens instead of expensive mainnet ETH for development and testing.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Learning Platform" icon="graduation-cap">
    Perfect environment for developers to learn and experiment with blockchain development.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By simulating the mainnet environment, testnets offer a realistic representation of real-world conditions, complete with network latency, gas fees, and other factors that impact the performance of smart contracts. This accurate representation enables you to identify potential issues, optimize your applications, and ensure the best possible user experience for your end-users.

Moreover, testnets allow you to familiarize yourself with the B3 ecosystem and gain valuable hands-on experience, making them indispensable tools for both seasoned developers and newcomers to the world of blockchain development.

## Development Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Testnet ETH">
  Use the [testnet faucet](https://testnet-faucet.b3.fun) to get free ETH for testing.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy and Test">
  Deploy your smart contracts to the testnet and thoroughly test all functionality.
</Step>

<Step title="Debug and Optimize">
  Use the block explorer and development tools to debug issues and optimize performance.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Mainnet">
  Once testing is complete, deploy your production-ready contracts to B3 mainnet.
  
  <Warning>
  Always test thoroughly on testnet before deploying to mainnet with real funds.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Testnet vs Mainnet

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Network Configuration">
  **Testnet**:
  - Chain ID: {networks.b3.testnet.chainId}
  - RPC: {networks.b3.testnet.rpc}
  - Explorer: {networks.b3.testnet.explorer}
  
  **Mainnet**:
  - Chain ID: {networks.b3.mainnet.chainId}
  - RPC: {networks.b3.mainnet.rpc}
  - Explorer: {networks.b3.mainnet.explorer}
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Token Value">
  **Testnet**: ETH has no real-world value - used only for testing
  
  **Mainnet**: ETH has real-world value and costs money to acquire
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Cases">
  **Testnet**: Development, testing, learning, experimentation
  
  **Mainnet**: Production applications, real users, actual transactions
