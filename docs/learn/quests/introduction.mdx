### **How Points Work**

Each quest can give up to **100 points total**, broken down into:

- **Quest Completion**
  - \+40 points for finishing the task
- **Virality Bonus**
  - 0–40 points based on engagement (likes, views, retweets, etc.)
- **Early Bird Bonus**
  - \+20 points for the fastest 10% of participants

**Virality tip:** Points are calculated when you click **Verify**. Waiting a bit for your post to collect likes or views before verifying may give you more points.

### Rewards & Leaderboards

- **Product-Level Quests (40%)** - Specific B3 products (AnySpend, BSMNT, Spawn, HypeDuel)
- **Chain-Level Quests (40%)** - Rewards across chains (B3, Reach, XRP, etc.)
- **Global Leaderboard (20%)** - Top performers across the entire ecosystem

Rewards are paid weekly to your connected wallet.

### FAQ

<Accordion title="Do I get points for every like/view/retweet?">
  Not 1-to-1. Engagement is used to calculate your percentile compared to other users. Higher engagement = more virality points.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why didn’t I get virality points?">
  Most likely, your post had low engagement at the time you clicked **Verify**. Remember, virality is checked at verification time only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I redo a quest?">
  No, each quest can only be completed once per account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why didn’t I get bonus points?">
  Bonus points depend on how early you complete the quest compared to others. Only the fastest users (top 10%) receive the Early Bird bonus. If you finished later, you’ll still get completion points but not the bonus.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When do rewards show up?">
  Rewards are tallied automatically and distributed weekly to your connected wallet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need both X and Farcaster linked?">
  Not required, but linking both maximizes your chances to earn points since you’ll have more quests available.
