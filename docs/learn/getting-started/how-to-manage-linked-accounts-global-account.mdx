### Disconnecting an Account

You may want to disconnect an account if you no longer use it, want to replace it with another, or simply prefer to keep your B3 Global Account linked to fewer logins.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click your profile icon in the top-right corner, then select **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Connected Accounts">
    In the Settings section, locate your list of connected accounts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disconnect the Account">
    Click the **chain link icon** next to the account you want to disconnect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The account will be removed immediately.

<Note>
  Disconnecting an account will not delete your B3 Global Account. You’ll still be able to log in using any other connected accounts.
</Note>


### FAQ

<Accordion title="Why can't I unlink my account?">
  You must always have at least one login method linked to your B3 Global Account. If the only account you have linked is the one you wish to disconnect, you’ll need to link another account first. Once you’ve added a new account, you can safely disconnect the one you want to remove.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I link more than one account?">
  Yes. You can link multiple accounts to the same B3 Global Account.
