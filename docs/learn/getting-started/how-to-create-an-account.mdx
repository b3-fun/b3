You only need one B3 account to access everything in the B3 ecosystem. Once your account is created, you can log in to any B3 platform using the same credentials.

You can sign up using an EVM wallet, email, phone number (SMS), or a social account like Google, Apple, Discord, Telegram, or Farcaster.

Your login is secure, flexible, and works across all current and future B3 products.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your B3 Account

You can create your account on any B3-powered site. Some of our most active platforms include:

- [**basement.fun**](https://basement.fun) - our main gaming hub
- [**stake.b3.fun**](https://stake.b3.fun) - the staking and rewards dashboard

The steps are the same no matter which platform you choose. For this walk-through, we'll start our journey on basement.fun.
