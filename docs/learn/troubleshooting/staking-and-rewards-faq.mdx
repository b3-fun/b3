<Accordion title="I staked but don't see rewards. What should I do?">
Wait a few minutes and refresh. If it still doesn't show, confirm your transaction succeeded on the blockchain. If your transaction succeeded, but you are still not accumulating tokens, contact support.

<Accordion title="I unstaked my tokens but I don't see them in my wallet. Where is my money?">
