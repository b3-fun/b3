## How Staking Rewards are Distributed

When you stake \$B3, you earn approximately 10% annual rewards, which accumulate over time. Rewards are not distributed on a fixed schedule. Instead, they are automatically claimed when you unstake. The amount you receive depends on how much you withdraw.

For example:

If you withdraw 50% of your staked \$B3, youâ€™ll receive 50% of your accumulated rewards at that time. The remaining rewards stay linked to the \$B3 you continue to stake.

This system ensures that rewards are distributed fairly based on how long and how much you stake.
