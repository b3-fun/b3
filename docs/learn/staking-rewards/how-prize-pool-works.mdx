The Weekly Prize Pool is your shot at big rewards just for being a staker. Every week, players from each reward tier - Rookie, Grinder, and Whale - can enter the pool for a chance to win. You'll need to manually join between Monday and Friday each week. Each Friday, three lucky participants from each tier are drawn and receive rewards based on their tier.

<Warning>
  **Important:** Make sure to enter the Weekly Prize Pool before Friday at 1:00 PM UTC.

## Claiming Your Prize

Once the raffle is drawn, you can return to the prize pool page to see if you've won. If selected, you have two options:

1. **Claim immediately** with a 10% fee deducted (5% to the protocol, 5% to the next jackpot)
2. **Stake your winnings** with no fee at all

  Staking your winnings is the best option as you avoid fees and continue earning rewards on your prize!
