## Overview

Integrating with Upside.win is simple. Your game runs in an iframe on our platform, receives player authentication via JWT, and interacts with the Upside backend through our SDK for bet placement and payout processing.

**Key principle**: Your backend handles game logic and state (cards, winners, outcomes), while Upside handles all WIN token transactions.

## Integration Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact B3 Team">
    Reach out to get your game approved and configured on Upside.

    ```text
    Contact: contact@npclabs.org
    Include: Game name, description, game type, and your backend URL
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Game Loads in Iframe">
    Players launch your game, which loads inside an iframe on upside.win. Your game receives: - JWT token for the player - Player authentication context - Access to the Upside SDK
  </Step>
  <Step title="Frontend: Receive JWT">
    Wrap your game with `ParentProvider` from the Upside SDK to receive the JWT.

    ```javascript
    import { ParentProvider } from "@b3dotfun/upside-sdk";
    
    export default function GameApp() {
      return (
        <ParentProvider>
          <YourGameComponent />
        </ParentProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backend: Place Bet">
    When a player starts playing, your backend calls `placeBet` to lock in their wager.

    ```javascript
    { createB3Client } from "@b3dotfun/upside-sdk/server"; 
    
    const b3Client = createB3Client(); 
    const betResult = await
    b3Client.placeBet(
      "coin-flip", // gameType 
      "100000000000000000" // betAmount in wei (1 token = 10^18 wei) 
    ); 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backend: Handle Game Logic">
    Your backend: - Determines game outcome (coin lands on heads/tails) - Stores game state in your database - Calculates payout amount - Prepares outcome data (player choice, result, outcome)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backend: Process Payout">
    When game ends, send the result to Upside to credit the player's WIN balance.

    ```javascript
    const payoutResult = await b3Client.processPayout(
      "coin-flip",      // gameType
      sessionId,        // unique game session ID
      payoutAmount,     // WIN tokens to award (0 if loss)
      // gameData
      {
        playerChoice: "heads",
        result: "heads",
        outcome: "win"
      }
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Frontend: Show Result">
    Your game displays the outcome to the player.

    The Upside platform automatically:

    - Updates the player's WIN balance
    - Adds the win/loss to leaderboards
    - Sends notifications
  </Step>
</Steps>
