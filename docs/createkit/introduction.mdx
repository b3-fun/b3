## What is CreateKit?

CreateKit, powered by the BaseMint Protocol, is a comprehensive TypeScript SDK that revolutionizes NFT collection creation and management. Built specifically for the B3 ecosystem, it provides a streamlined, gas-efficient workflow for deploying and managing NFT collections with minimal costs and maximum flexibility.

- Manage collection metadata and URIs
- Support for different media types (3D models, artwork, video, memes)

### ðŸ”’ **Secure Deployment**
- Two-step signature verification process
- Creator signature validation
- Deployer signature validation
- Collection address prediction

### ðŸŽ¯ **Token Operations**
- Mint ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens
- Whitelist-based minting with Merkle proofs
- Automatic price calculation
- Built-in parameter validation
- Gas-efficient transactions

### ðŸ’° **Reward Distribution**
- Track creator rewards
- Monitor per-collection reward accumulation
- View total and unclaimed rewards per collection
- Track reward distribution per recipient type
- Withdraw accumulated rewards

## System Flow

The BaseMint protocol provides a unique, gas-efficient workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collection Creation & Signature Generation">
    Creators define collection parameters and generate cryptographic signatures stored off-chain with zero gas costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Off-chain Storage & Discovery">
    Collection data is stored securely in BaseMint storage with deterministic addresses for easy discovery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment & First Mint">
    The first minter triggers on-chain deployment in a single transaction that covers both deployment and first mint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Minting Phase">
    Open minting for all users with optional whitelist support and wallet limits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reward Structure

CreateKit features an innovative reward system that benefits all participants in the ecosystem:

| Recipient Type | Default Share | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Creator** | 40% | Collection originator |
| **First Minter** | 30% | Initial deployer who triggers deployment |
| **Game Owner** | 20% | Platform integrator |
| **Platform** | 10% | Protocol fee |

<Note>
Reward rates are configurable by the protocol owner and can be adjusted based on ecosystem needs.
</Note>

## Supported Networks

CreateKit supports the B3 ecosystem with planned expansion to additional networks:
